* Plan

Follow Ghuloum's paper closely. 

* Julia specific

- for jump to definition: can simply use ~etags *.jl~
- default equality test for structures compare fields using ~===~
  (identity), not ~==~ (equality). Define it manually to i.e. compare
  ASTs.
- see =AST.BinaryOp= for an example of how to define mutually
  recursive types

* Dump of things to implement
- ternary (parse)
- loops
- my own assembler
- my own linker
- constant propagation / static optimizations (i.e. replace =40+2= by
  =42=)
- proper type checking

* Notes

** TODO Rudimentary type checking
- idea:
  - a function to build a type expression from a declaration
  - a function to find the type of an expression, and if the
    expression itself passes type check
- for that I need to really understand how declarations work in C,
  with all the subtleties of syntax.

How to construct C types ? (every bold term is taken from the
standard):
- *basic types*: signed and unsigned integer types, floating types and
  char

#+begin_src c
  int *a, b;
#+end_src
- only a is a pointer right ? :: yes

Now we need to have a big piece. The tree for the grammar of
declaration is quite cumbersome to parse type from declarations;
furthermore, we have some redundancy with the type names (that is
basically a declaration without an identifier, with some more
subtleties).
** DONE Try compiling a program with addition of literals

How does the stack work ?
- assume everything writes to =%eax=
- if a binary op:
  - compile first subexp
  - save eax to the stack
  - compile second subexp
  - add the two, and save to =%eax=
- for this I need a way to keep track of the stack size
  - I can change io to context, and use a single global

** DONE Unary primitives

Will be simpler than binary ops.
- is =-10= parsed as an unary op or a constant ? :: as an unary op

** DONE Local variables
- can variables be local to any compound statement in C99 ? :: yes I think
- how to deal with nested environments ?
  - use a stack (vector) of Dict{String, Int}
    - int to store often on the stack
    - pop this stack of envs, along with the stack counter when block
      is over
- first deal with assignment expressions

** DONE Conditional expressions

** TODO Stateful parsing

I need a way to keep track in real time of which identifiers are used
for typedefs.

For now I can just forget about that, and do as if typedef did not
exist. This allows for the =declaration-specifiers= to be purely
keywords.
   
** Implementing assembly generation
   
- how is a function organized ?
  - return type :: 
  - declarator :: to simplify, =function_name(function_params)=
  - compound statement for the body
- =_start= will be the entry point, and will call =main=, to make it
  like an ordinary function, able to use =ret= and so on

** Notes about assembly
   
- use AT&T syntax, since it is what's used by Ghuloum and the GNU
  Assembler

Size suffixes:
| suffix      | b    | s                    | w    | l                    | q    | t        |
| meaning     | byte | short / single       | word | long                 | quad | ten      |
|-------------+------+----------------------+------+----------------------+------+----------|
| size (bits) | 8    | 16 (int), 32 (float) | 16   | 32 (int), 64 (float) | 64   | 80 float |
